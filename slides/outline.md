#Why is this good for me

##If you build with a mainstream MVC framework
- Simplifies fetching data compared to REST
- Eliminates API versioning
- Decreases overall complexity of front end code

##If you’re a meteor developer
- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- Gives you a logical place to store ORM functionality
-

#Disclaimers
- There are a million _"intro to graphql"_ talks and blog posts, I don't want to reinvent the wheel, so if the core grqphql concepts are unfamiliar, please refer to any one of these.

- GraphQl is not a product, its an **idea**.

- Adopting it won't tie you to any programming language, or database.

#Main points
- What sets GraphQl apart
  - Databases are about

- Whats the point

- Why is this good for Meteor
  - Clears up the fuss about sql support              <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Makes meteor friendlier for enterprise adoption   <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


- Its not mandatory,
  - Just like the rest of the changes hitting the meteor ecosystem lately, it’s an added choice used to compose a custom stack
